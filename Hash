1️⃣ First question: What does “analyze a hash” mean?

You can analyze a hash in four different ways:

Goal	What you can learn
Identify hash type	SHA‑256, MD5, bcrypt, etc
Check salting	Likely salted or not
Check randomness / entropy	Bit distribution, entropy
Attempt recovery (cracking)	Only if authorized

⚠️ You cannot reverse a secure hash. Analysis ≠ cracking.

2️⃣ STEP‑BY‑STEP HASH ANALYSIS IN KALI

Assume your hash is in hash.txt.

STEP 1 — Identify hash type
Tool: hashid (Kali default)
hashid hash.txt


Output example:

Analyzing '5e884898da...'
[+] SHA-256
[+] SHA-256(HMAC)


🔹 Tells you:

Possible algorithm(s)

If it might be salted (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.)

Tool: hash-identifier
hash-identifier


Paste the hash → interactive detection.

STEP 2 — Check if the hash format shows salting

Look at the hash structure:

Format	Meaning
$2b$12$...	bcrypt (salted)
$argon2id$...	Argon2 (salted)
pbkdf2_sha256$...	PBKDF2 (salted)
64 hex chars	SHA‑256 (salt unknown / none)

👉 Raw SHA‑256 has no visible salt.

STEP 3 — Check duplicates (salting inference)
Tool: sort + uniq
sort hashes.txt | uniq -d

Result	Meaning
No output	Likely salted or unique inputs
Duplicates	Very likely unsalted

STEP 4 — Analyze randomness / entropy (important)
Tool: ent
xxd -r -p hash.txt > hash.bin
ent hash.bin


Key values:

Entropy ≈ 8.0 bits/byte → excellent

Serial correlation ≈ 0

Chi‑square reasonable

🔹 This checks statistical quality, not salting.

STEP 5 — Deep statistical testing (optional)
Tool: dieharder

⚠️ Only for large datasets, not single hashes.

dieharder -g 201 -f hashes.bin


Interpretation:

Some FAILs are normal for hashes

This does not determine salting

STEP 6 — Check if it’s crackable (authorized testing)
Tool: john
john --format=raw-sha256 hash.txt

Tool: hashcat
hashcat -m 1400 hash.txt wordlist.txt


If cracking fails easily → probably salted or strong password.

3️⃣ IMPORTANT TRUTH (Most people get this wrong)

✔ You cannot prove a hash is salted from a single value
✔ Random-looking ≠ salted
✔ Entropy ≠ salting
✔ dieharder ≠ salt detector

Salting is about input uniqueness, not output randomness.

4️⃣ RECOMMENDED KALI TOOLS SUMMARY
Tool	Purpose
hashid	Identify hash algorithm
hash-identifier	Interactive ID
ent	Entropy / randomness
sort + uniq	Detect duplicates
john	Hash analysis / cracking
hashcat	Advanced cracking
xxd	Hex → binary
5️⃣ Correct professional workflow (short)
1. Identify hash → hashid
2. Check format → manual
3. Check duplicates → uniq
4. Check entropy → ent
5. Optional cracking → john/hashcat

✅ FINAL ANSWER

To analyze a hash in Kali:

Identify it

Check format

Check duplicates

Measure entropy

Understand limitations

If you want, tell me:

Is it password hash or token/API key?

Single hash or many?

For learning or security audit?

I’ll tailor the exact commands for your case.
