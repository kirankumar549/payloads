Vulnerability Name
Exposed SSRS Login Interface (Publicly Accessible Authentication Portal)

Description
When the SSRS login page (e.g., /Reports/Pages/Folder.aspx or /ReportServer) is exposed to the public internet, it allows unauthenticated attackers to interact with the authentication interface. Even if credentials are required, this exposure creates several risks:

Brute-force or credential stuffing attacks using leaked credentials.

Enumeration of usernames based on error responses.

Information leakage (e.g., software version in error messages).

Target for bots or malware scanning the internet for known vulnerabilities.

Public availability of this login interface increases the attack surface for unauthorized access to potentially sensitive business reports and underlying infrastructure.

Impact
Risk	Description
Unauthorized Access	If weak or default credentials are used, attackers may gain access to sensitive reports.
Data Breach	Sensitive business intelligence (BI) data may be exposed.
Regulatory Non-Compliance	Violates data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS.
Brute Force Attack	Automated tools can be used to guess credentials.
Reconnaissance	Helps attackers understand internal systems and software versions.

Remediation
✅ Restrict Network Access
Only allow access to the SSRS portal from trusted internal IP addresses or VPN users.

Use a reverse proxy or firewall to block public internet access to the login page.

✅ Implement Strong Authentication
Use Windows Authentication or integrate with Active Directory.

Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

✅ Prevent Brute-force Attacks
Enable account lockouts or rate-limiting after failed login attempts.

Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) with brute-force protection rules.

✅ Disable or Hide Unused Endpoints
Disable or remove default report folders that aren't in use.

Remove test/sample reports and endpoints if not necessary.

✅ Secure Communication
Ensure the portal uses HTTPS only, with a valid certificate.

✅ Regularly Patch and Update
Keep SSRS and SQL Server components fully patched to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

✅ Monitor and Audit Logs
Enable detailed auditing and review logs for signs of reconnaissance or login attempts.
