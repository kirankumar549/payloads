You can analyze unknown hashes solely for collision detection and type identification using these exact Kali Linux tools and commands—no original PII needed.��Hash Type IdentificationTool: hashid (pre-installed on Kali Linux, identifies 220+ hash types by format/length).�# Single hash
hashid 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

# From file (hashes.txt, one per line)
hashid -m hashes.txtAlternative CLI: haiti (Ruby gem, 641+ types).�gem install haiti-hash
haiti 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592Collision DetectionTool: Standard Unix sort + uniq (detects duplicate hashes indicating collisions).�# Save hashes to file: hashes.txt (one per line, lowercase hex for consistency)
# Count collisions
sort -u hashes.txt | wc -l     # unique count
sort hashes.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10  # collisions first (count >1)If any line shows    2 abc123... → collision between 2 records.�Entropy / Randomness CheckTool: ent (Kali Linux, statistical test for randomness).�# Install if needed: sudo apt install ent
